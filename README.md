- 🚀 Passionate about full-stack development, I have experience building applications with React and Angular, leveraging both frameworks to create dynamic and efficient front-end solutions. On the backend, I work

  experiences.

  Flask, further strengthening my capabilities in front-end and back-end development while exploring new approaches to modern web architecture.
